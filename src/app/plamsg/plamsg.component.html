<p class="para styleattribute ">We take this opportunity to welcome you to Rayat Bahra Institute of Engineering and NanoTechnology (RBIENT), Hoshiarpur, an inspiring and vibrant Technical Institute. We would like to share with you that it is only the students who make Rayat Bahra Group of Institutes and especially RBIENT, Hoshiarpur, an amazing educational hub. We are proud that we are recognized among the top Educational Institutes in the region. But we have yet a long way to go - dreams to fulfill, heights to reach and responsibilities to carry out.  Educated men and women are the real wealth of a nation. So it is necessary to ensure that besides a sound education, our students have the ability to engage and win in the global context. Knowledge is only as powerful as the application of it, and as useful as the care that goes into the application. Let's put wisdom in education by combining knowledge with application, compassion and insight. We aspire that all our students will be caring, sensible and determined human beings. They become leaders in their sphere – not just capable students or competent workers but men and women with ideas of their own, ready to change the future. We expect our students to have courage to think differently, courage to invent, to travel the unexplored path, courage to discover the impossible and to conquer the problems and succeed. These are the qualities that they must work towards. Although the excellence of faculty, the dedication of our staff, and the interest and the support of our patrons are essential ingredients contributing to our success, the caliber and commitment of our students is most vital.
</p>
<p class="para styleattribute">We dare our students to dream, to work smart and strive for nothing less than excellence. Believe in yourself, your mentors, peers and partners. Don't compromise on ethics and your beliefs. We expect our students to have the motivation to go through a rigorous programme and realize their full potential.</p>
<p class="para styleattribute">We are hopeful that our students enjoy and excel in their journey of Engineering and Information Technologies with us here at <b>Rayat-Bahra Institute of Engineering &amp; Nano Technology Hoshiarpur</b> and we are quite confident that this will prepare them for rewarding careers.<br>Come, let's change the world and make it a better place to live.<br>Best Wishes,</p>
